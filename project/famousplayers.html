                <h3>Roger Federer</h3>
                <p>No list of tennis greats is complete without him. After turning pro in 1998, Roger Federer mesmerised the tennis world with his silky touch and a breathtaking game that saw him win 20 Grand Slam titles, a record surpassed only by his fiercest rivals -- Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic.

                    Roger Federer won his first Grand Slam in 2003 at Wimbledon. A win over Andy Roddick in the semi-finals was followed by a comfortable three-set win over Mark Philippoussis for the title.
                    
                    Over the years, the Swiss ace mastered the art of Grand Slam title wins with Wimbledon's grass being his favourite surface. Roger Federer won as many as eight titles at Wimbledon, a record.</p><br>

                <h3>Rafael Nadal</h3>
                <p>There are only a handful of players who can rival Roger Federer’s achievements and his closest friend outside the court, Rafael Nadal, is one of them.

                    Born in Mallorca, Spain, the southpaw turned pro in 2001 and won his first-ever Grand Slam in 2005 at the French Open.
                    
                    Having led Spain to a Davis Cup title as a teenager a year before, and with a dominant run in the clay-court season that year (he won 24 consecutive singles matches), Nadal was already a hot property ahead of his debut French Open.
                    
                    The Spaniard showcased his baseline prowess to beat top-seed Roger Federer in the semi-final and then got the better of Mariano Puerta in the final. Nadal became only the second men’s player to win Roland Garros in his maiden attempt after Mats Wilander in 1982.</p><br>

                <h3>Novak Djokovic</h3>
                <p>A relatively late entrant into this big boys' league of legends, Serbia’s Novak Djokovic has carved a place for himself among the best tennis players in the world.

                    Having turned pro in 2003, Djokovic took five years to win a Grand Slam trophy at the Australian Open. Djoker, as he’s lovingly called, now has 24 Grand Slam titles, seven ATP Finals crowns and has 40 ATP Masters 1000 crowns to his name -- a record -- apart from the 90-odd tour title wins.
                    
                    No other men's singles player in the history of tennis has won more Grand Slam titles than Novak Djokovic. He also holds the record for most men's singles Grand Slam matches won, surpassing Federer's tally of 369 at the French Open 2024.
                    
                    Novak Djokovic has also won the Australian Open a record 10 times and is the only men's tennis player in the Open era to have achieved a double Career Grand Slam - winning each of the four majors at least twice.</p><br>

                <h3>Serena Williams</h3>
                <p>Serena Williams left no stone unturned to create a legacy laced with triumphs and records for herself.

                    Though the American great officially turned pro in 1995 as a 14-year-old, Serena Williams couldn’t compete freely for long given the age limitations that WTA had on professional tennis players.
                    
                    Her initial years as a pro was spent by competing in a few select events that handed her a wildcard entry but Serena Williams soon stepped up a gear.
                    
                    In 1999, a 17-year-old Serena Williams became only the second African-American woman to the US Open title after Althea Gibson in 1958 and in three years, completed a calendar Slam with some stupendous performances. The American great has won the maximum number of Grand Slam titles (23) in the Open era in the women’s game, one behind Margaret Court’s record of 24.</p><br>

                <h3>Steffi Graf</h3>
                <p>Having turned pro in 1982, Germany’s Steffi Graf was someone the world adored for her playing style that mixed swift footwork and powerful groundstrokes in equal proportion.

                    Her versatility and the ability to adapt to any playing surface made her one of the most successful players of her generation and it’s why Graf dominated women’s tennis in the early years of the Open Era. It’s believed that it was Steffi Graf who made the baseline game popular for later champions like Serena Williams to master.
                    
                    The German won 22 Grand Slam titles, a record that Serena Williams later broke, and is the only player in history to complete a Golden Slam -- a run that includes winning the four Grand Slams titles and the Olympic gold in the same season. Steffi Graf achieved this feat in 1988.</p><br>

                <h3>Martina Navratilova</h3>
                <p>Unlike other legends, Martina Navratilova is a rare gem. While most of the tennis greats have often succeeded in the singles game, the Czechoslovak-born American is among the few who have done well in both the singles and the doubles.

                    In fact, Martina Navratilova is the only tennis player to be the top-ranked in both the singles and the doubles for over 200 weeks.
                    
                    For a tennis journey that started in 1975 and lasted till 2006, Martina Navratilova ensured that she left a lasting legacy to inspire the next generation.
                    
                    Be it her 18 Grand Slam singles titles or the 31 major women’s doubles titles -- a record -- or the 10 major mixed doubles titles, Martina Navratilova is someone who entertained the spectators with her grace and finesse, often relying on her serve and volley game to decimate opponents.</p><br>
