            <h2>What is something that you learned during our time together and how do you plan to apply it in your life?</h2><br>
            <p>I feel more confident in my CSS and HTML programing skills. I definitely still need to work on JS but I feel like I have a good starting point for it. This will help me in my next classes and working towards getting my degree.
                This term I have been working on increasing my faith. I have made great progress. I made a goal this year to read to understand the Book of Mormon. I'm almost done reading the Book of Mormon, just 2 chapters left!
            I have been reading the Book of Mormon made easier by David Ridges it has helped me so much! Im finally reading and understading what im reading I feel like it will be the first time in my life to read with an understanding of the book of Mormon</p>
